    description: ` After Elon Musk's Twitter takeover, Republicans asked him to 'free' the suspended account of former US President Donald Trump. In a tweet, Republicans said, "Hey, @elonmusk it's a great week to free @realDonaldTrump.
              Republicans have been critical of Twitter for banning former President Donald Trump and other notable conservatives.
      
              Trump's account, which had more than 88 million followers, was his primary communication tool during his presidency. He repeatedly used Twitter to claim his defeat in the November 2020 election was due to widespread voter fraud, and he urged supporters to come to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, and march on the US Capitol to protest the election result.
      
              Days after the storming of the Capitol, Twitter said it was permanently suspending Trump’s account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.
      
              Political activists expect Trump could get his account restored after Musk's takeover of Twitter.`,

    description: `On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that trade, commerce, defence, and clean energy figured prominently in his talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Both countries also launched their Global Innovation Partnership (GIP) as the two leaders discussed bolstering the innovation ecosystem to benefit start-ups.
      
              GIP is expected to lend a template to use the Trilateral Development Corporation (TDC) Fund for projects with other countries like Japan, Germany, France, and the European Union willing to work with India on innovation and development. India and the UK have agreed to co-finance GIP to implement its various components.
              
              Let's first understand the TDC Fund and GIP, and why they are crucial.
              
              India recently launched the TDC Fund designed to involve private sectors with state support for investment in the Indo-Pacific region (comprising the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the western and central Pacific Ocean, and the seas connecting the two in the general area of Indonesia) and beyond.
              
              India aims to use the TDC Fund to contribute to GIP that will globalise Indian start-ups and innovations with help like grants, development capital investment and tech assistance.
              
              GIC comes against the backdrop of the UK offering 5G, nuclear and high-speed rail technologies for China's Belt-Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure development strategy adopted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping as his foreign policy centrepiece.
              
              While in India, PM Johnson said, "The world faces growing threats from autocratic states which seek to undermine democracy, choke off free and fair trade and trample on sovereignty." TDC may provide an alternative to China's development partnership model that has deepened Chinese influence over some of India's neighbours and pushed them into debt traps.
              
              CHINA'S DEBT TRAP
              But what's China's debt trap? Through investments in infrastructure development, China has been scrambling to deepen its influence and economic clout over India's neighbours, such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.
              
              China saw the Sri Lankan civil war as an opportunity to outcompete India. Several geopolitical experts cite Sri Lanka as an example of China's "strategic or debt-trap" diplomacy. A significant part of China's lending is linked to BRI. The Chinese loan model is simple. That's how it generally works.`,

    description: `Ola Electric announced on Sunday that the company is recalling 1,441 units of its electric two-wheelers in the wake of incidents of e-bikes catching fire. These scooters will be inspected by engineers and will go through diagnostics across all systems.
      
              In a statement, Ola said it is investigating a fire incident that happened in Pune on March 26. According to Ola's preliminary assessment, it was found that the incident was an isolated one.
              
              "As a pre-emptive measure, we will be conducting a detailed diagnostic and health check of the scooters in that specific batch and therefore are issuing a voluntary recall of 1,441 vehicles," Ola Electric said in its statement.
              
              "These scooters will be inspected by our service engineers and will go through diagnostics across all battery systems, thermal systems as well as safety systems," the company said.
      
              Ola Electric said its battery systems already comply with and is tested for AIS 156, the latest proposed standard for India, in addition to being compliant with the European standard ECE 136.
              
              Recently, there have been widespread incidents of electric two-wheelers catching fire in various parts of the country, especially in Tamil Nadu, forcing manufacturers to recall their vehicles.
      
              An electric bike emitted smoke in Tamil Nadu's Thiruppur on April 11. That was the fourth such incident of e-bikes catching fire or emitting smoke in three weeks in the state since a father-daughter duo died after an electric bike exploded while charging.
      
              The incidents also prompted Centre to form a panel to examine and warn companies of penalties if they were found to be negligent.`,

The action flick, which is a sequel to his 2018 film KGF, went on to become yet another successful hit from the south belt.
      
            Within a time span of 7 days, the film crossed the humongous Rs 700 Crore mark at the global box office. For now, the film has crossed yet another Sunday with flying colours. As per early estimates, the Yash-starrer has grossed nearly Rs 45 Crore on day 11. After its 11-day theatrical run, the total collection of KGF 2 now stands at Rs 862.25 Crore.
      
            Well, with no major releases to clash with apart from Beast and Jersey, KGF 2 is expected to do well in the days to come. Notably, south biggie Acharya is releasing on April 29, and one will have to wait and watch to see if the Yash-starrer surpasses Chiranjeevi-Ram Charan's most awaited film when it finally sees the light of day. Written and directed by Prashanth Neel, KGF 2 follows Rocky (Yash), an assassin who after establishing himself as the kingpin of the Kolar Gold Fields is on a mission to retain his supremacy over adversaries. Featuring Srinidhi Shetty, Sanjay Dutt, Malavika Avinash, Prakash Raj and Saran, the film has cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda, music composed by Ravi Basrur and editing carried out by Ujwal Kulkarni.`,

    tags: "Cinema",
    description: `Ever since films like Pushpa: The Rise, RRR and KGF: Chapter 2 set the box office on fire, many netizens took to Twitter to laud the directors from the South belt of the country. While some lauded them, others criticised Bollywood filmmakers for not bringing anything new to the table. 
            In his recent tete-a-tete with a leading daily, when actor Ajay Devgn was asked to share his opinion on the ongoing north vs south debate, here's what the actor said...
      
            He said that it boils down to the numbers, and the numbers in the south are really huge. "If you were to analyse it - look at the number of theatres across north centres as compared to the South markets. Their reach (South) is a lot more. We know of probably four films from the South which have worked, but there are several that have also not done as well. What also works for them is that they manage to promote their films better as there is a lot of unity there, and unity in every way," added Devgn. He went on to add, "Even the stars there are unified, from what I have seen as an outsider and my interactions with them. They are united, and they work as one force, not for a particular film, but for the industry."
      
            Recently, Ajay Devgn featured in SS Rajamouli's blockbuster RRR, which also starred Ram Charan and Jr NTR in the lead roles. Even though Ajay and Alia Bhatt had special appearances in the film, they were praised immensely for their screen presence. With respect to work, Ajay is currently gearing up for the release of Runway 34, which is slated to be released on April 29, 2022.

    date: "April 25 2022",
    tags: "Cinema",
    description: `Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui believes reinventing as a performer is the only way to not become “jaded” in the film industry. In his career of more than two decades, Siddiqui has received acclaim in almost every film — from his early breakout roles in Black Friday, and Kahaani to films which were riding on his shoulder like Gangs of Wasseypur, Badlapur and Photograph.
      
            The actor said he never takes his audience for granted and hence his attempt is always to look for “something more” when a character comes his way.
            
            “It is on you if you’re making your character challenging enough. If you’re doing that, means you’re still curious. It is an ongoing process. The day I stop the process thinking that the audience will love me anyway as I am a great actor, my downfall will begin.
            “Here, you can get too comfortable with the praise that comes your way, it can make you feel jaded. If I take that love, the audience for granted, I am finished,” the 47-year-old told PTI.
      
            Citing a cricket analogy, Siddiqui said just because a cricketer has hit a century in his last match, doesn’t mean he gets to start his next from 100. “He also starts from zero. That’s how acting is. Every film of mine, be it the big screen masala entertainers or so-called artistic films, my process remains the same: I always start from the scratch. I unlearn and then go into any project. That’s what keeps me on my toes and makes me be more receptive to challenges.”
      
            The actor is currently awaiting the release of his next, Heropanti 2. The actioner, headlined by Tiger Shroff, is among those projects that feels like a departure from the Siddiqui brand of movies, which are often mounted on a smaller scale but almost always guarantee a thought provoking cinematic experience.`,

            He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.
          
          The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.
          
          Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.
      
          "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," Mr Musk said in a statement announcing the deal.
          "I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans," he added.
      
          "Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."

      "Former US President Donald Trump who may return to Twitter soon although at the moment he seems to be demurring.",
    date: "April 25 2022",
    tags: "Technology",
    description: `Elon Musk is buying Twitter in a $44 billion deal. Once the deal is complete, Twitter will again be a private company, wholly owned by Musk. And with Musk insisting on making the site a haven for absolute free speech, chances are that former US President Donald Trump will be back on it soon. This despite the reports that claim Trump has no intention of returning to Twitter.
      
          Less than an hour after Twitter announced the deal with Musk, Trump told Fox News that this would change nothing. "I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on TRUTH," said Trump. "I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH.”
          
          But that seems more like Trump demurring. There is a buzz that Twitter under Musk will be kinder to Trump than it was under Dorsey and Parag Agarwal. The reason is that Musk seems to be taking a line that all free speech is free speech irrespective of what is said. In fact, in the announcement made by Twitter on the deal on Monday night itself contains clues that Musk will be more tolerant of all that Twitter users say in their tweets.
          
          In the press note by Twitter, there was a statement from Musk. He said, “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.”
          
          In the name of free speech, chances are that as soon as the deal is complete and Musk owns Twitter, he is likely to lift the ban on Donald Trump. The former US President was banned by Twitter to stop him from tweeting in the wake of his loss in the US polls in 2020.
          
          Although Musk hasn’t commented on the Trump vs Twitter issue, recently when he spoke at a TED event he said that he wasn’t in favour of lifetime bans. That statement can be interpreted as a sign that Musk is likely to lift the ban that Twitter imposed on Trump.
      
          Although, is not clear if Musk supports Trump’s politics or not, chances are that he also doesn’t mind Trump as much as some other Silicon Valley executives do. Musk and Trump apparently share similar scepticism about covid vaccines and mask mandates. And as the statement that Trump gave to Fox News — Musk is a good man — shows, Trump too likes Musk.`,

Earlier this month, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting banned 22 channels on YouTube, 18 were based in India and 4 in Pakistan.
        details:
        Stating the reason for the blocking, PIB said it “observed that these channels were used to spread fake news over social media on matters related to national security, India’s foreign relations, communal harmony in the country, and public order.

          The government of India said that the “content published by some of the India-based YouTube channels referred to a community as terrorists, and incited hatred among the members of various religious communities. Such content was found to have the potential to create communal disharmony, and disturb public order.” In addition, PIB also said that it found multiple India-based YouTube channels publishing “unverified news and videos having the potential to create panic among various sections of society.”
          
          YouTube channels based in Pakistan were found posting fake news about the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India’s foreign relations in the light of the situation in Ukraine, etc. “The content of these channels was observed to be completely false, and sensitive from the perspective of national security, sovereignty and integrity of India, and India’s friendly relations with foreign States,’ PIB noted.`,

They had booked flights with stopovers in Abu Dhabi and Frankfurt but due to the raging pandemic, they rescheduled their flight and headed straight to the UK. However, upon reaching the UK, they realised that their luggage has not arrived. Interestingly, Sharod had placed an AirTag inside each bag to locate them easily. Using the Find My App, they discovered that their bags had reached Frankfurt but they were not put on a London-bound plane. The couple were travelling in Are Lingus airline.
          
          
          Sharod told CNN that the bag had not moved since April 21. The airline was unable to find the bag, so then he complained to the police. He said that the bag contained his wife’s wedding dress."Helen's gutted," he said. "It's her bag, her clothes, and she has that very uneasy feeling about where her property is.”`,

            It does not come as a shocker that Russia has barred Zuckerberg from entering the country because Russia had previously banned Facebook and Instagram under extremism law. Facebook and Instagram, the widely used apps in Russia, were accused of “carrying out extremist activities”. However, Russia did not ban WhatsApp, which is another Facebook entity, stating that the app is used for communication and it is not a source of miscommunication.

    description: `Hollywood’s response to climate change includes donations, protests and other activism. but it’s apparently missing out on an approach close to home.
      
            Only a sliver of screen fiction, 2.8%, refers to climate change-related words, according to a new study of 37,453 film and TV scripts from 2016-20. A blueprint for ways to turn that around was released Tuesday.
            
            “Good Energy: A Playbook for Screenwriting in the Age of Climate Change” was created with feedback from more than 100 film and TV writers, said Anna Jane Joyner, editor-in-chief of the playbook and founder of Good Energy, a nonprofit consultancy.
            
            “A big hurdle that we encountered was that writers were associating climate stories with apocalypse stories,” she said in an interview. “The main purpose of the playbook is to expand that menu of possibilities....to a larger array of how it would be showing up in our real life.”
            
            Among those who provided funding for the playbook project are Bloomberg Philanthropies, Sierra Club and the Walton Family Foundation.
            
            Waves of celebrities have been sounding the climate alarm, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jane Fonda, Don Cheadle and Shailene Woodley. DiCaprio also starred in “Don’t Look Up,” the 2021 Oscar-nominated film in which a comet hurtling toward an indifferent Earth is a metaphor for the peril of climate-change apathy.
            
            But the playbook is asking writers and industry executives to consider a variety of less-dire approaches, Joyner said, with examples and resources included.`,

She said, "We all lived there when we were doing Ocean's Twelve. We all lived at George's house. Can you imagine? I was pregnant and you would have thought I was made of glass. My bedroom was on the first floor because they didn't want me to take the stairs. They just wanted to dress me in cotton balls and usher me and it was really, really charming."`,

            JOHNNY DEPP-AMBER HEARD'S LEGAL BATTLE
      
            After Johnny Depp filed a $50 million lawsuit against Amber Heard for her op-ed, she sued him back. A part of the defamation complaint filed by Depp’s lawyer read, "The op-ed's clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false. Her allegations are part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career."
          
            The defamation trial will be broadcast live and there are around 120 people on the potential list of witnesses. It will feature testimony from witnesses like James Franco, whom Heard claims to have confided in about the bruises she got due to her fight with Depp. Other high-profile witnesses are Depp’s friend Paul Bettany and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who reportedly had knowledge of the abuse during his and Amber’s 2016-2018 relationship.
          
            ABOUT THE CASE
            In 2018, Johnny Depp had sued a British tabloid for an article that referred to him as a "wife beater". He lost the case. Now, he is riled up in the defamation case against Amber Heard. 
          
            Johnny Depp and Amber Heard had met on the sets of The Rum Diary in 2009 and started dating a few years later. In 2015, they got married. In 2016, Heard filed for divorce and alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their marriage under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Depp denied the accusations and stated that Heard was "attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse."
      
            Their divorce was finalised in 2017. Since 2018, Depp filed the defamation case against Heard for her opinion piece on domestic abuse.`,

This can help you discover where you're tense and where you're out of balance. You can utilise this knowledge to re-establish balance and alignment in your life. Back pain is very common these days and we see every other person complaining about the same. Yoga might be a medicine for it.
      
          India Today talked to advanced yoga trainer, Manali Sharma for her expert advice on this matter.
          
          While yoga isn't recommended if you have severe pain, people who have periodic soreness or chronic aches may find that some particular poses can help extend your spine, stretch and strengthen your muscles, and realign your back, says Manali Sharma, a yoga trainer based in Seattle, US.
          
          She also says that the main reason such pain happens is because of the long sitting hours or long-standing hours we spend.
          
          “Any beginner can start doing these asanas for back pain relief. Any posture that you are in for a long time can create such problems. So the advice would be to keep moving after every hour, stand up and stretch your body.” Says Manali Sharma.`,

    description: `Heart disease has emerged as one of the biggest threats in the world even as people suffer the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. A new study now hints that consuming avocado could help in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.
      
          The study published in the journal American Heart Association found that eating plant-based unsaturated fats can enhance diet quality and is an important component in preventing cardiovascular disease.
          
          Researchers conducted the study on 68,786 women and 41,701 men to conclude that "higher avocado intake was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease."
          
          Avocados are rich, creamy, and single-seeded fruit with a mild flavour that is said to have originated in Mexico. They can be used as a fruit or a vegetable in the kitchen, and are frequently sliced and tossed into salads, pureed into soups or smoothies, or mashed into guacamole.
          
          It can be used in many forms, such as oil for cooking, or moisturizer for hair or skin. An avocado also offers numerous health benefits and can be consumed on a daily basis.
          
          However, it is very important to have a balanced diet with plenty of variety rather than to concentrate on the benefits of individual foods.
          
          FACTORS LEADING TO HEART DISEASE
          Dr Pallavi Aga, MD Doctor, and lifestyle consultant told India Today that the important factor behind heart diseases is a rise in the intake of processed food.
          "Intake of too much sugar in the form of sweet dishes, soft drinks and fruit juices, refined oil and a sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance is a factor behind inflammation and heart issues," says Dr Aga.
      
          Talking about the study, she said that avocados are a rich source of mono-unsaturated fatty acids which are very beneficial and rich in potassium, fibre, and folate. Hence, they are a superfood.`,

    description: `If you cross the Walserschanze, which represents the German-Austrian border, holidaymakers can enjoy a view of one of the most beautiful high mountain valleys in the Austrian Alps: the Kleinwalsertal.
            
            The Austrian Kleinwalsertal, which can only be reached from Germany, with its four towns of Riezlern, Hirschegg, Mittelberg, and Baad lies at an altitude of between 1,086 m – 1,244 m and promises a great holiday for every taste.
      
            The valley was settled around 1270 by Walsern, an ethnic group that migrated from the upper Valais (Switzerland). The dialect has been preserved quite well and differs significantly from the neighbors in Vorarlberg or Allgäu.With around 5,000 inhabitants, the valley is divided into 4 villages: Riezlern, Hirschegg, Mittelberg and Baad. The Kleinwalsertal covers an area of ​​97 km². It is about 15 km long and about 6.5 km wide. The municipality is named after Mittelberg. At the highest point of the village in Austria is the parish church of St. Jodok with the oldest church tower in the Kleinwalsertal, immediately behind is the Lourdes Chapel from 1897.
      
            Mittelberg and the surrounding nature are perfect for everyone who wants to switch off from everyday stress and instead want to immerse themselves in nature. Whether for hiking, cycling or eating out with a view, Mittelberg is the perfect starting point. The best time to visit this region of Austria is certainly summer, preferably in May and June, when the meadows are in bloom. We would recommend to stay four to seven days to discover Mittelberg.`,

          Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.
      
          "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," Mr Musk said in a statement announcing the deal.
          "I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans," he added.

    description: `Hollywood’s response to climate change includes donations, protests and other activism.but it’s apparently missing out on an approach close to home.
            Only a sliver of screen fiction, 2.8%, refers to climate change-related words, according to a new study of 37,453 film and TV scripts from 2016-20. A blueprint for ways to turn that around was released Tuesday.
            
            “Good Energy: A Playbook for Screenwriting in the Age of Climate Change” was created with feedback from more than 100 film and TV writers, said Anna Jane Joyner, editor-in-chief of the playbook and founder of Good Energy, a nonprofit consultancy.
            
            “A big hurdle that we encountered was that writers were associating climate stories with apocalypse stories,” she said in an interview. “The main purpose of the playbook is to expand that menu of possibilities....to a larger array of how it would be showing up in our real life.”
            
            Among those who provided funding for the playbook project are Bloomberg Philanthropies, Sierra Club and the Walton Family Foundation.
            
            Waves of celebrities have been sounding the climate alarm, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jane Fonda, Don Cheadle and Shailene Woodley. DiCaprio also starred in “Don’t Look Up,” the 2021 Oscar-nominated film in which a comet hurtling toward an indifferent Earth is a metaphor for the peril of climate-change apathy.
            
            But the playbook is asking writers and industry executives to consider a variety of less-dire approaches, Joyner said, with examples and resources included.`,

          The ban will come into force on Thursday (April 28) and is set to continue for an undetermined length of time, the President said. "I will continue to monitor and evaluate the implementation of this policy so that the availability of cooking oil in the country is abundant and at an affordable price," Widodo said in a statement.
          
          LARGEST PALM OIL EXPORTERS
          Indonesia and Malaysia are the world's largest exporters of palm oil, which plays an important role in their economies. They account for 85 per cent of global palm oil production, according to an Associated Press (AP) report.

          Indonesia is not only the world's largest producer of palm oil but also meets nearly 50 per cent of the total palm oil requirement in India annually.
          
          The cooking oil industry was prepared for a tweak in export duty, at worst by Indonesia, which is grappling with its cooking oil price spike in their domestic market by about 40-50 per cent.
          
          Indonesia was levying $575 per tonne export duty.
          
          PRICES TO GO UP?
          The cooking oil national industry body -- Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) of India has suggested immediate initiation of government to government (G2G) dialogue with Indonesia on the proposed palm oil export ban from April 28 by them as it would have adverse repercussions in India.`,

      "Rising international prices of wheat and fuel are pushing wheat prices up at home. There is also a demand for India to export wheat",
    date: "April 25 2022",
    tags: "Food",
    description: `India’s CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation rose to a 17-month high of 6.95 per cent in March 2022, exceeding the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation target for three consecutive months. The prices of wheat and wheat products in the country have gone up by 15-20 per cent while global wheat prices are at a 14-year high. The escalation in global wheat prices is driven by the ongoing geopolitical turmoil—Russia’s war on Ukraine, which has led to massive supply disruptions.
      
          However, back home, the increase in prices comes on the back of five consecutive bumper harvests. Godowns are overflowing with wheat, which, amongst food items, forms a major component of CPI. Wheat/ wheat flour is lower than only rice in its weightage in CPI. India’s wheat output has been consistently high for the past five years. The country’s wheat inventory was reported at 23 million tonnes at the end of February 2022. Stocks of wheat with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) touched a record high of 60 million tonnes, much higher than the buffer norms for July.
          
          Several factors are pushing wheat prices up at home. These include international prices of wheat and rising fuel costs, which have a spillover effect on commodities used for ethanol production, such as corn and wheat. With rising global wheat prices, there is a growing demand for wheat to be exported. Himanshu, an agricultural economist from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, says the rising prices make for a strong case for the government to continue with the free ration scheme to the poor till at least March 2023. The government had stated that the scheme will be offered till September this year.
          
          Meanwhile, companies like ITC, Adani Wilmar and Hindustan Unilever are building their wheat stocks by buying in record quantities at a time when the Centre’s wheat procurement has declined by about 32 per cent to 69.24 lakh tonnes till April 17 of the ongoing rabi marketing year, as against 102 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period. The Centre had set a target of purchasing 444 lakh tonnes of wheat in the 2022-23 marketing year as against 433.44 lakh tonnes in the previous year.
          
          The government’s procurement of wheat in Haryana was at 28 lakh tonnes till April 17 of the current marketing year, as against 44 lakh tonnes last year. In Madhya Pradesh, 9 lakh tonnes of wheat have been purchased so far as compared to 17 lakh tonnes during the same period last year. Farmers are selling to corporates, who are paying them more than the MSP (minimum support price). But as Himanshu warns, “The private sector is crowding out the public sector. Large corporates are stocking up wheat; they will hold it until the prices are higher and create an artificial scarcity in the market. It could spiral.”
          
          Should the government sell its stocks in the open market? Opinion varies. Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd, says selling in the open market could bring down inflation while Himanshu believes the government needs to build reserves. With the Ukraine war on, the world could be staring at a food crisis, considering that Russia and Ukraine are Europe’s bread basket. For India, it makes all the more sense to have its coffers full.`,

    description: `The age-old practice of raising the bar and slowly venturing into Hollywood land is not foreign to Bollywood stars. From time immemorial, some of the A-listers from Tinsel town have risen to noteworthy fame as they became part of Hollywood projects alongside respected artists from the industry. As they pursued their dreams of parallel roles in the West - they brought great glory and pride back to India with their widespread presence in the world of performing arts.


    The latest to join the bandwagon is none other than one of the youngest superstars of Bollywood - Alia Bhatt. This is a year of firsts for many reasons to her, but her big Hollywood debut alongside Gal Gadot and Jamie Dornan in Heart Of Stone has raked up a much-heated discussion. Pondering on the same, here's a little throwback to all the Bollywood stars who ventured into Hollywood over the years and basked in the glory of the success achieved in the West.
    
    
    Anil Kapoor who only ages backward has been a household name not only with his Bollywood representation but with his projects abroad as well. His journey from 24 to the Oscar-nominated Slumdog Millionaire by exceptional filmmaker Danny Boyle was revolutionary and put him on the global map.
    
    The lines are increasingly blurring with the opportunities coming from Hollywood to Bollywood. A horde of respected stars from Tinsel town has gone to the West and made a great name for themselves with their impressive body of work. Only leaves us to continue with the discussion of who's next and what's next from a global domination perspective by Bollywood stars.`,

    description: `Karan Johar is one of the most talked-about Bollywood directors and producers. He is celebrating his 50th birthday today. The celebrations began last night, and inside birthday bash photos have been surfacing on social media. In the midst of all this excitement, Karan previously took to his Twitter handle to tease a special announcement, leaving his fans in suspense.
    
    Now Karan has shared a note on his Instagram where he looked back on his journey in the Bollywood industry. “Hello all. This is a note of reflection and one of immense excitement! I turn 50 today (a number that seemed like a distant nightmare), while I know it's kind of a mid-point of my life but I can't help my wannabe millennial self from existing. Some call it a mid-life crisis, I proudly call it just 'living life without any apologies'. I have worked in the movie industry for over 27 years and I'm blessed to have had the best experience ever!!! Telling stories, creating content, nurturing talent and watching the finest artists perform in front of my privileged eyes... these years are like being in a massive dream that made all the sleeplessness seem worthwhile! I am grateful for the brickbats, the bouquets, the praising souls, the public trolls....ALL OF IT!!! It's all been a huge part of my learning curve and self growth.....”


    He continued, “The one aspect that I believe I am most passionate about is being a filmmaker! In the past I have always taken long gaps between my films but today on this special day I would like to announce my next directorial feature....Rocky aur Rani ki Prem Kahani will release on the 10th of February 2023.”


    For his big announcement, Karan revealed that he would be directing an action film next: “And I will commence the shoot of my ACTION FILM in APRIL 2023. Need your blessings and love! And I have to shamelessly sign off by saying Jug Jugg Jeeyo to all of you.....My love forever, Karan Johar.”`,

    description: `Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Taylor Swift, Swara Bhaskar, and Selena Gomez are among the other celebrities who shared their condolences for the lives lost at the tragic school shooting that took place in Texas. A teenage gunman killed at least 19 children and 2 adults at a Texas elementary school on Tuesday.

    Priyanka Chopra Jonas shared a news clipping on her Instagram story to voice her sorrow. She wrote, “Condolences are not enough. There needs to be more done. So tragic."
    
    Selena Gomez also reacted to the tragic shooting saying, “Today, in my home state of Texas, 18 innocent students were killed while simply trying to get an education. A teacher killed doing her job; an invaluable yet sadly under-appreciated job. If children aren’t safe at school where are they safe? It’s so frustrating and I’m not sure what to say anymore. Those in power need to stop giving lip service and actually change the laws to prevent these shootings in the future,”
    
    Bollywood actress Swara Bhasker also shared condolences. She wrote, “What the hell is going on in the USA?!! This is horrific and tragic! Seems entirely avoidable too .. why are gun laws not changing in the USA? 14 children dead in a school & only 10 days after the #Buffalo shooting. My heart goes out to the parents & families.”

    Pop singer Taylor Swift tweeted, “Filled with rage and grief, and so broken by the murders in Uvalde. By Buffalo, Laguna Woods and so many others. By the ways in which we, as a nation, have become conditioned to unfathomable and unbearable heartbreak. Steve’s words ring so true and cut so deep.” She also shared a clip of basketball coach and former player Steve Karr, who spoke about the incident emotionally.`,

    description: `In what went down as one of the most shocking moments in the history of the Oscars, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage after the comedian used his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, as the punchline of his joke. The incident that took place at the 95th Academy Awards sent shockwaves across the board and Smith was banned by the Academy. Now, months after the controversial slap, Craig Erwich, the President of Entertainment at ABC, has revealed that the show was a success in his opinion. 

    As per reports on Deadline, Erwich has hinted that he's open to having Chris Rock host the Oscars in 2023. Talking about the 2022 Oscars, he told the portal, "My assessment of the Oscars was that it was really a successful year for the show. Obviously, there was a lot of controversy, which overshadowed a lot of the positive things about the show, but I was really happy with the programme."
    
    Addressing the slap, he said, "Even before that very unfortunate moment, the show started off up year over year, and we came back in a big way."

    The Oscars this year were hosted by Amy Schumer, Regina Hall, and Wanda Sykes. CODA emerged as the winner of the Best Picture award, while Dune won the most number of honours. Will Smith also bagged the Best Actor award for his role in King Richard. Much has been said about the show and its flaws, but the slapgate has managed to overshadow everything. Since then, Smith has been off the radar and was earlier spotted in Mumbai. `,

    description: `The new trailer of Thor : Love and Thunder is here. The film directed by Taika Waititi and starring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson and more will see the God of Thunder go on an all-new journey. After offering a brief glimpse of the upcoming film, the makers have now dropped a full-length trailer and it has finally given us our first look at the film's big bad villain - Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher.


    The trailer opens with Chris Hemsworth's Thor who after the happenings of Avengers: Endgame has left his old ways for a more peaceful life. We also see him go through a body transformation from "dad bod" to "God bod". He then meets Natalie Portman's Jane aka Mighty Thor, Thor's ex-girlfriend who is now worthy of Mjolnir. More importantly, we see Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher and he's truly terrifying. 

    This is our closest look at Bale's MCU debut and he seems poised to join the ranks of the best comic book movie villains already. Apart from the spine-chilling reveal, the trailer also sees Russell Crowe's Zeus and a fun glimpse of Jane and Valkyrie bonding.

    description: `The action-packed trailer of The Gray Man, the next film from the Russo Brothers (the director duo behind Avengers: Endgame) is finally here. The film, based on Mark Greaney's novel of the same name, is an action thriller with a star-studded cast. Starring Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Dhanush and Ana de Armas, the film is one of the most anticipated titles coming up this year.

    The full-length trailer of The Gray Man offers a glimpse of what looks like an agent-on-the-run story. It introduces us to Ryan Gosling's Court Gentry, an undercover CIA operative with a target on his back. We then see Chris Evans' antagonist Llyod Hansen rocking a "trash-stache" as pointed out by Gentry. They lock horns and are also seen in a chase sequence. More importantly, we get a shot of Dhanush going up against Ryan Gosling. His unnamed character packs quite the punch. We also see Ana de Armas' Dani Miranda in a rather bloody combat scene.
    
    The trailer seems to tease just the right mix of action and subtle humour. So far, details of Dhanush's mystery character have not been revealed. Earlier, the badass first look of Dhanush in what looks like a superhero landing was unveiled.
    
    The official synopsis reads - The Gray Man is CIA operative Court Gentry (Ryan Gosling), aka, Sierra Six. Plucked from a federal penitentiary and recruited by his handler, Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton), Gentry was once a highly-skilled, Agency-sanctioned merchant of death. But now the tables have turned and Six is the target, hunted across the globe by Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), a former cohort at the CIA, who will stop at nothing to take him out. Agent Dani Miranda (Ana de Armas) has his back. He’ll need it.`,

    description: `The wait for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the most mysterious addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is finally over. The Sam Raimi directorial is headlined by Benedict Cumberbatch who reprises his role as the titular Doctor Strange and Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff. The film which also casts Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams, Xochitl Gomez and more is set to unleash chaos as the MCU forays further into the multiverse. At this point, the possibilities are endless. Between the Defender Strange, evil Wanda and a long list of speculated cameos, the film's trailer has divulged a bunch of details sparking some wild fan theories. Amidst all the anticipation and everything going on elsewhere in the MCU (try keeping up with 27 films and 5 shows), remembering key details can get tricky.


    Doctor Strange 2 is a lot of things aside from the biggest movie release of the month. It's a sequel to the 2016 film that introduced the character. It's a follow-up to WandaVision and more importantly, it chronicles the aftermath of the mind-bending events of Spider-Man: No Way Home. It is also an opportunity for Spider-Man director Sam Raimi to flex a little and infuse his signature horror into the MCU. Before heading into theatres to experience magic and madness, here's a quick glance at key details you must know. 
    
    Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness spotlights MCU's top magic users - Strange and Wanda. So knowing their whereabouts is essential, duh. While Benedict Cumberbatch's last appearance was in Spider-Man: No Way Home, Elizabeth Olsen led WandaVision. The former was dealing with the fallout from a miscast spell while the latter was seen living in isolation. That's where they left off in the MCU. The two haven't shared screen space before but they have a bunch of things in common. Apart from magic, they fought alongside the Avengers in the Battle of Earth against Thanos. Wanda and Strange both go up against the Mad Titan in crucial scenes so it isn't a surprise that they already know each other (or at least know of each other) and Strange reaches out to her for help with his little multiverse problem.

    If you paid attention while watching Spider-Man: No Way Home, you will know that Doctor Strange currently does not hold the title of the Sorcerer Supreme. Yes, he is a genius neurosurgeon-turned-sorcerer with an unparalleled mastery over the mystic arts. He was also instrumental in saving the world. Technically he checks all the boxes to take over the role after the Ancient One but he also vanished for five years after Avengers: Infinity War as fans will remember. In the meantime, Wong got the title and is expected to keep it after the events of No Way Home.

    He also explained that power clean helps to increase “muscular coordination, leading to better power output, and enhancing overall athletic capacity”. “Such kinds of explosive compound movements yield great results not only in power and force output but also kinesthetic awareness, and neurological adaptations, which is required by athletes to train harder and run faster,” the expert mentioned.

    description: `Stress has become a part of life, but instead of living with it, we must find the tools with which to combat it. Yoga is one such tool that can deal with physical, emotional and mental issues caused by stress, and give you a better perspective of life.

    According to Samiksha Shetty, a certified yoga educator and the founder of Moon Village Cafe, yoga postures (asanas), breathwork (Pranayama) and meditation induce a sense of calm and relaxation from within, and if you are looking for how you can de-stress, this is what you need to know.
    
    “In yoga, we use movement and breath to release stuck energy along the spine and throughout the body. The mind-body connection created in yoga facilitates change at a cellular level. Our nervous systems can rewire by retraining psychological or emotional triggers that set off our flight-or-fight response,” she explains.

It helps in numerous ways, be it in improving flexibility, strength and posture, or reducing stress and providing a sense of calm. Nutrition and diet are an important part of fitness along with physical exercise. On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or not.

    Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.

    “We must put in some fuel before we start our day. One date or a couple of halves of fruit so that you jumpstart your metabolism and then be able to fuel the rest of your exercise with yoga,” she said.

    On the other hand, Anshuka tilts towards doing yoga on an empty stomach to make the best of your breathwork.

    She said, “ I believe yoga should be done first thing in the morning on an empty stomach so that it doesn’t disrupt the breath that you regulate from within.”

    description: `Whatever may be the rhetoric or the narrative, even if the latter is a preponderantly dominant one, truth finds its own place to emerge. For years, many sections of Indian society, principally the right-wing segment, have peddled the story that India is primarily a vegetarian nation. Proclamations of this sort have been made time and again, although archaeological and anthropological data do not give any credence to such claims and assertions. The Vedas too do not support this narrative. In fact, it is unequivocally held that it was unviable to depend only on vegetarian food anywhere in the world even during the Vedic times.

    The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data (conducted between 2019-21) show that the proportion of men aged 15-49 years who refrained from consuming “non-vegetarian” food, that is, fish, chicken or meat (to be categorical, any meat) were a mere 16.6 per cent. Besides the fact that it is such a miniscule proportion of the population, what is more illuminating and significant is the revelation that there has been a 5 percentage-point drop from the 21.6 per cent recorded in the earlier round of the survey, that is, NFHS-4, conducted in 2015-16. However, in the case of women, the reduction was almost insignificant – it dipped from 29.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 29.4 per cent in 2019-21.

    Stated differently, a staggering 83.4 per cent of men and 70.6 per cent of women in the 15-49 age group are non-vegetarian according to the NFHS-5 data. The corresponding figures from the NFHS-4 were 78.4 per cent for men and 70 per cent for women. So, is there any room for those who peddle the “vegetarian nation” rhetoric to hide? And if so, where?

    description: `Indian government said in a Tuesday announcement that it is capping sugar exports at 10 million metric tons for this current marketing year — which runs through September — to ensure domestic availability of the commodity and ensure "price stability." The restriction will start on June 1.

    India is the world's second-largest producer and exporter of sugar after Brazil. Major importers of Indian sugar include Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The South Asian country exported 7.2 million tons of sugar in the last marketing year, according to the US Department of Agriculture — well short of its new export cap.
    
    India doesn't face a sugar shortfall, according to the US Department of Agriculture. However, like in many countries, food inflation in India has risen sharply in the last year, putting pressure on the government to soften the impact on the electorate.
    
    "Uncontrolled exports could create scarcity and local prices could spike during festive season," a senior government official told Reuters on Wednesday. India is the world's largest sugar consumer and celebrates its biggest festival, Diwali, in October this year.
    
    International sugar prices have already surged 20% in the last 12 months due to various factors including supply shocks and recovering demand from the pandemic. Also boosting prices is a surge in global energy prices, as the gains are driving mills in Brazil to produce biofuel from sugar-based ethanol instead.
